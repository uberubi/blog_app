As the home of the world-famous street artist Banksy, London has gone down in history across the globe as beginning the evolution of graffiti art. Although Banksy chooses to remain anonymous and the British public still has no information on his true identity, London holds masses of his work, wall displays and capitulation paintwork. Banksy now holds exhibitions around the world in cities such as Milan, Moscow, Toronto, Berlin and many more!
